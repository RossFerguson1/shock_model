'''Calculates Synchrotron Emission from Thermal & Non-thermal Electrons

This module contains the functions needed for computing the shape of the Equal Arrival Time Surface (EATS) for a shock moving at arbitrary velocity used in Ferguson and Margalit (2025; FM25) given a function for the shock radius R(t). The main function is hydrodynamic_variables, which returns a variety of useful radii and the arrays needed to interpolate the emitting region behind the shock at a given time t. These functions generally do not need to be changed even when the assumed hydrodynamics is altered (the changes are controlled mainly by R, which is given in the flux_variables module). However, changing the resolutions of the interpolations is occasionally necessary, particularly for ultra-relativistic shocks.

This file can be imported as a module and contains the following functions:
    *R_EATS_interp : Returns an array of EATS radius values as a function of an array of times
    *R_EATS : Interpolation of the EATS radius as a function of mu and T
    *X_perp_calc : Finds X_perp, the maximum perpendicular EATS radius
    *mu : mu = cos(theta) as a function of (x,y); see Section 3.1 of FM25
    *y_min : Calculation of the minimum value of y on the EATS (located at the back of the shock along the LOS); see Appendix B in FM25
    *x_bound_interp : Calculation of all x and y values located at the EATS, using Equation 5 in FM25
    *t : Emission time (retarded time) as a function of y 
    *hydrodynamic_variables : The main function in this module; returns key radii and arrays needed to draw the EATS boundary
